# predicting hard drive failures

With this exercise we want to be able to predict HD failures.
The dataset that is part of this exercise has been slightly modified for the purpose of the project.
 
The data is available for free at https://www.backblaze.com/b2/hard-drive-test-data.html. The only remarks are:

1) you cite Backblaze as the source if you use the data, 2) you accept that you are solely responsible for how you use the data, and 3) you do not sell this data to anyone, it is free.
